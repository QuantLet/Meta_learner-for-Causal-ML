Published in: CATE meets MLE - A tutorial

Description: Inverse probability weighting (transformed-outcome) method to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) via a variety of machine learning (ML) methods.

The data structure has to be the following: 
- y = outcome variable
- d = treatment variable
- covariates = the covariates to map on d or y
- learners = the machine learning methods to use in the [SuperLearner package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SuperLearner/vignettes/Guide-to-SuperLearner.html).

Keywords: CATE, ML, IPW, causal-inference, treatment
